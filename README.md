# jjAgglomerator

This code is an exercise in learning something new. It is an experiment at creating 
a filter to combine a group of `.csv` files into a single file while eliminating duplicates.

It is being developed with JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA, using the Cursive plugin. A feature to note 
about Cursive is that it tries to be too helpful sometimes with its _structural editing_. This can 
be turned off in the status bar at the bottom of the screen.

## Installation

You need to have `leiningen` installed to work with the code 

## Usage

You can find instructions on how to run the application by running the following command:

    lein run -- --help
    
This will print out a help message describing the parameters that can be supplied to the application.

The application can be run standalone by running the produced `.jar` file as follows

    $ java -jar jjAgglomerator-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
